# Introduction of webgis-pub


The repository is the source codes for //webgis.pub in Sphinx project structure.
There are Python codes for some automated stuff for MapServer, 
and lots of JavaScript demos for Leaflet/OpenLayers.

The idea of this website is comes on https://demo.mapserver.org/tutorial/ 
and has undergone significant improvements.

Went through a series of refactoring.

1. Rebuild with PHP, using templates.
2. Integrated into TorCMS to serve as dynamic website.
3. Using Python to write the SSG for Mapfile processing,
   and using Jinja2 for webpage management.
4. Sphinx is introduced for the management of the pages.
   And keep the scripts for Mapfiles.

Based on MapServer, and would supply WebGIS relevant technologies.

There are a large number of historical legacy issues that need
to be addressed during the conversion process.
All the pull requests are welcome.
