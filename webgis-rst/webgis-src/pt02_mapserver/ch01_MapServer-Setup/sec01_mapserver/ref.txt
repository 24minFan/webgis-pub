An important distinction should be made between vector data and raster data, because each is used and stored differently.
The vector representation of a geometric object basically consists of a list of coordinates that define the points of the object.
A grid object, on the other hand, consists of a series of values that represent a digital image.
A vector object by definition contains explicit spatial references; a grid object, because it is just an image, needs to be marked so that it can be properly positioned, oriented, and scaled.
